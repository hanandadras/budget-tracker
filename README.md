# Budget Tracker Starter Code# budget-tracker
The budget-tracker application allows for offline access and functionality to help users add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. 
When users change ransactions offline, the app allows the budget to be updated when they're online.
This app uses express for the server, mongoDB and mongoose for the database, the organ logger middleware function using the given format and options and the compression middleware to compress response bodies for requests traversing through the middleware based on given options.
